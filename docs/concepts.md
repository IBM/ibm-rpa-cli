# RPA CLI concepts
To fully leverage the IBM速 RPA Command Line Interface (RPA CLI), you need to understand how RPA CLI treats WAL scripts, projects, robots, environments, and how RPA CLI introduces concepts not part of IBM速 RPA offering, such as packages and package sources.

## Scripts
WAL scripts are treated as source code files. They are not treated as robots. You cannot deploy scripts to environments. RPA CLI deploys [robots](#robots). This is fundamentally different from IBM速 RPA.

## Robots
Robots are the result of the [build](reference.md#rpa-build) process. Robots are created using source code files such as WAL scripts, but they are *not* source code files. Although a robot can be composed by several WAL scripts, a robot always has one **main**, also known as **entry point**, WAL script. The **main** script is what gets executed by the runtime engine. The other scripts are just dependencies. The **main** script cannot function without the dependencies. Fetching dependencies *on demand*, a common construct used by RPA developers, has a major [performance](guide/execute-script.md#performance) penalty. Therefore, RPA CLI does not publish every script to Control Center. RPA CLI embeds dependencies into the **main** script, creating a new script, and that is what gets deployed.

## Projects
Although limited to Control Center, [projects](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/rpa/23.0?topic=interfaces-projects) are a concept in IBM速 RPA. But you cannot open or create projects within Studio or locally in you laptop. You cannot group source code files - WAL scripts - locally as part of a project.

RPA CLI introduces **local** projects. Local projects are enabled by defining a file structure such as the *configuration file* (see [managing projects](guide/project.md)) where developers can manually (or through RPA CLI) change project configurations without relying on UI. Changes that can be tracked, merged, and reviewed by 3rd-party versioning source code tools such as GIT.

With RPA CLI, you can start your project locally and only deploy it when needed. You do not need to create a [Control Center project](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/rpa/23.0?topic=interfaces-projects) to start working on your automation idea. Work locally and [deploy](guide/deploy.md) later. RPA CLI takes care of creating or updating the Control Center resources.
