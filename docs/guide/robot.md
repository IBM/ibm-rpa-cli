# Managing bots
Although limited to Control Center, [bot](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/rpa/23.0?topic=scripts-bots) is a resource defined in IBMÂ® RPA. Read the [robot concept](concepts.md#robots) explanation to understand the definition of robots in the context of RPA CLI.

## Prerequisites
To issue `rpa bot` commands you need to have a project configuration file within the working directory. See [managing projects](guide/project.md) section.

## Creating a robot
Issue the following command to create a robot within the working directory, replacing `[name]` with the robot name and `[template]` with one of the available templates: *unattended*, *attended*, *chatbot*, *excel*, *package*.

```bash
rpa bot new [name] --template [template]
```

The above command updates the configuration file named `[project_name].rpa.json` adding a *robots* property, where `[project_name]` is the project name, `[name]` is the specified robot name, and `[type]` is derived from the specified `[template]`.
```json
{
  "description": "[project_name]",
  "robots": {
    "[name]": {
      "type": "[type]",
      "timeout": "00:05:00",
      "description": "[name]"
    }
  }
}
```

The command also creates a WAL file named `[name].wal` within the working directory, where `[name]` is the specified robot name. This WAL file is the **entry point** or **main** file of the robot. If your code references other WAL files using the [executeScript](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/rpa/23.0?topic=general-execute-script) command, those references will be embedded into the main file through the [build](reference.md#rpa-build) proccess.

You can also specify specific properties that are not part of the command parameters by default. This mechanism is used when defining specific properties for robot types like unattended and chatbot. Use `-p:<key>=<value>` to specify properties and their values, where `<key>` is the name of the property, and `<value>` is its value. For example, `timeout` property is not part of the default parameters of `rpa bot new` command, so you can specify it like so:

```bash
rpa bot new [name] --template [template] -p:timeout=00:05:00
```

### Unattended
Unattended robot type has one extra **required** configuration for deployment of the project: `computer-group`. You need to specify a valid [computer group](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/rpa/23.0?topic=computers-managing-computer-groups) **name** either manually in the configuration file or through the command line using the `-p` parameter, like so: `-p:computer-group=[computer_group_name]`.

Example:
```json
{
  ...
  "robots": {
    "[name]": {
      "type": "[type]",
      ...
      "computer-group": "[computer_group_name]"
    }
  }
}
```

When you [deploy](guide/deploy.md) the project with unattended robots, Control Center [bots](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/rpa/23.0?topic=scripts-bots) are created or updated accordingly.

### Attended
When you [deploy](guide/deploy.md) the project with attended robots, only WAL scripts are published. Support for creating Control Center [launchers](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/rpa/23.0?topic=interfaces-launchers) is coming soon.

### Chatbot
Chatbot robot type has four extra configuration for deployment of the project: `handle` (**required**), `computers` (**required**), `name`, `greeting`. You can specify them either manually in the configuration file or through the command line using the `-p` parameter, like so: `-p:handle=[handle] -p:computers=comp1,comp2`.

- `handle` (**required**): a valid chatbot handle, also refered as [chatbot instance](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/rpa/23.0?topic=saas-requesting-chatbot-instance).
- `computers` (**required**): valid comma-separated [computer names](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/rpa/23.0?topic=interfaces-computers).
- `name`: the chatbot mapping name. If not provided, the *robot description* will be used.
- `greeting`: the chatbot mapping greeting. If not provided, it will be empty.

Example:
```json
{
  ...
  "robots": {
    "[name]": {
      "type": "[type]",
      ...
      "handle": "[handle]",
      "computers": "[computer_names]"
    }
  }
}
```

When you [deploy](guide/deploy.md) the project with chatbot robots, Control Center [chat mappings](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/rpa/23.0?topic=chatbots-chats-mappings) are created or updated accordingly.

## Updating a robot
You can update any robot configuration by changing the `[name].rpa.json` file, where `[name]` is the project name. RPA CLI updates the [Control Center bots](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/rpa/23.0?topic=scripts-bots) using the configuration file as part of the [project deployment](guide/deploy.md).

## Deleting a robot
!> **Warning**: RPA CLI does not delete resources previously deployed if you remove robots from the configuration file.

## Dependencies
The [build](reference.md#rpa-build) proccess looks for [executeScript](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/rpa/23.0?topic=general-execute-script) commands and embed them as dependencies in the **main** file.

For cases where you *dynamicaly* reference a WAL file, you can explicitly define dependencies in the configuration file by adding the `include` property in the `robot` property. The `include` property expects an array of WAL script paths relative to the working directory.

Example:
```json
{
  ...
  "robots": {
    "[name]": {
      "type": "[type]",
      ...
      "include": ["path_wal_file_1.wal", "packages/path_wal_file_2.wal", "..."]
    }
  }
}
```

[Package](guide/package.md) references are also automatically embedded by the [build](reference.md#rpa-build) process.
