# Support
RPA CLI is open sourced and support relies on the contributors.

* Open a [github issue](https://github.com/IBM/ibm-rpa-cli/issues/new?template=bug_report.yml) for support.
* Open a [github request](https://github.com/IBM/ibm-rpa-cli/issues/new?template=feature_request.md) for new features.
* Open a [github question](https://github.com/IBM/ibm-rpa-cli/issues/new?template=question.md) for doubts.

## Troubleshooting
You can troubleshoot errors by specifying the `-v Detailed` option to get more logs into the console for any [available commands](reference.md). For example:

```bash
rpa pull -v Detailed
```
