# Support
RPA CLI was designed and implemented by one author and currently **does not offer any support**.

## Troubleshooting
You can troubleshoot errors by specifying the `-v Detailed` option to get more logs into the console for any [available commands](reference.md). For example:

```bash
rpa pull -v Detailed
```
