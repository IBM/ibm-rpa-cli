# Support
RPA CLI is open sourced and support relies on the contributors.

Open a [github issue](https://github.com/IBM/ibm-rpa-cli/issues/new) for support.

## Troubleshooting
You can troubleshoot errors by specifying the `-v Detailed` option to get more logs into the console for any [available commands](reference.md). For example:

```bash
rpa pull -v Detailed
```
