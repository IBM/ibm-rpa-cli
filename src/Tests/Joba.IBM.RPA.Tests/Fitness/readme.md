# Fitness functions
This directory contains fitness functions implemented as tests.

## What are fitness functions?
> Any mechanism that performs an objective integrity assessment of some architecture characteristic or combination of architecture characteristics.

In the RPA CLI project, we implement fitness functions as a mechanism to test the **architecture** of the system, enforcing rules to be followed by developers, like forbidding some library packages to be installed in the *Joba.IBM.RPA* core project.
